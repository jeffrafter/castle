== Knight Foundation RSS And News on Cell Phones (RANC) by DataDyne

Adminstration and portal website for management of regions and content channels 
for SMS. This will also act as the cache for user subscriptions and content.

There are more than 3 Billion mobile phone subscribers in the world (2008) and
many, if not all have access to a simple stateless prototol called SMS. Only
1.5 Billion people have used the Internet (2008) meaning that there is a large
population which is connected but cannot use the Internet. Bridging the gap
with SMS will make available vast functionality and services that were 
previously not usable.

This project is composed of a simple gateway (proxy) that feeds commands to 
a remote server for translation and management.
