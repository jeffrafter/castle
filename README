== Knight Foundation RSS And News on Cell Phones (RANC) by DataDyne

Adminstration and portal website for management of regions and content channels 
for SMS. This will also act as the cache for user subscriptions and content.

There are more than 3 Billion mobile phone subscribers in the world (2008) and
many, if not all have access to a simple stateless prototol called SMS. Only
1.5 Billion people have used the Internet (2008) meaning that there is a large
population which is connected but cannot use the Internet. Bridging the gap
with SMS will make available vast functionality and services that were 
previously not usable.

This project is composed of a simple gateway (proxy) that feeds commands to 
a remote server for translation and management.

== Dependencies

The controllers are simplified using a few gems:

  jeffrafter-resource_controller
  jeffrafter-clearance
  
For testing you will need:

  thoughtbot-factory_girl
  thoughtbot-shoulda
  mocha
  
  
== Future

Need better localization
Users are tied to their initial gateway, might be better as region specific 
If a user reaches quota max, then asks for more, it won't give them archived messages, only more new messages going forward
