Someone, hopefully you, has requested that we send you a link to change your password.

Here's the link:

<%= edit_user_password_url(@user, 
      :email    => @user.email, 
      :password => @user.encrypted_password,
      :escape   => false) %>

If you didn't request this, don't worry: your password hasn't been changed. You can just ignore this email.
